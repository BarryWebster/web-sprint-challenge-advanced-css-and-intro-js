# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

Accessibility in programming means making web pages and the internet accessible to all people, regardless of how they need to interact with a page. This includes people with auditory disabilities, visual disabilities and any other type of physical disabilities; as well as people who can only access mobile devices or have slow internet. 

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

    1) Adding Responsive Units such as scalable units in CSS - REM, EM or %(percentages).
    2) Using semantic tags when coding in HTML and using meaningful id and class names as well as giving all images "alt" text.
    3) Use colors that contrast well and avoid using colors that are red or green. When possible, use a visual counterpart, like a symbol, in colorful displays that are trying to convey a message (e.g. the stop symbol or a picture of a hand).

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

First, a variable is a symbolic name or letter that we give to a set of information we'd like to reference. In programming, a variable (i.e. symbolic name) represents any possible values that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the computer program.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

The purpose of using functions is to avoid writing code multiple times. Functions allow developers to repeat sections of code with just a single line, keeping the code DRY.

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

By typing the following notation together (with no spaces):

    a) Object name
    b) The numerical position (index) of the key in the array 
    c) Using either dot or bracket notation to access the key and lastly, the key's name.

Please see the following examples:

Example 1 - objectName[indexNumber].keyName 
or 
Example 2 - objectName[indexNumber]['keyName']

Note, for Example 2 (bracket notation) you must use a string or number or variable pointing to a string or number to access the key. You have to use bracket notation if your keys are strings with spaces in them.

    

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and work on the main branch
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. connect to codegrade
5. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
6. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
7. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
